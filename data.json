        "body": "April is the cruellest month, breeding\nLilacs out of the dead land, mixing\nMemory and desire, stirring\nDull roots with spring rain.\nWinter kept us warm, covering\nEarth in forgetful snow, feeding\nA little life with dried tubers.\nSummer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee\nWith a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,\nAnd went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,\nAnd drank coffee, and talked for an hour.\nBin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch.\nAnd when we were children, staying at the archduke’s,\nMy cousin’s, he took me out on a sled,\nAnd I was frightened. He said, Marie,\nMarie, hold on tight. And down we went.\nIn the mountains, there you feel free.\nI read, much of the night, and go south in the winter. \n\n What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow\nOut of this stony rubbish? Son of man,\nYou cannot say, or guess, for you know only\nA heap of broken images, where the sun beats,\nAnd the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,\nAnd the dry stone no sound of water. Only\nThere is shadow under this red rock,\n(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),\nAnd I will show you something different from either\nYour shadow at morning striding behind you\nOr your shadow at evening rising to meet you;\nI will show you fear in a handful of dust.\n\t\tFrisch weht der Wind\n\t\tDer Heimat zu\n     \t\tMein Irisch Kind,\n     \t\tWo weilest du?\n“You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;\n“They called me the hyacinth girl.”\n—Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,\nYour arms full, and your hair wet, I could not\nSpeak, and my eyes failed, I was neither\nLiving nor dead, and I knew nothing,\n Looking into the heart of light, the silence.\nOed’ und leer das Meer. \n\n Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,\nHad a bad cold, nevertheless\nIs known to be the wisest woman in Europe,\nWith a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she,\nIs your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor,\n(Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)\nHere is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks,\nThe lady of situations.\nHere is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel,\nAnd here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,\nWhich is blank, is something he carries on his back,\nWhich I am forbidden to see. I do not find\nThe Hanged Man. Fear death by water.\nI see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.\nThank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,\nTell her I bring the horoscope myself:\nOne must be so careful these days. \n\n Unreal City,\nUnder the brown fog of a winter dawn,\nA crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,\nI had not thought death had undone so many.\nSighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,\nAnd each man fixed his eyes before his feet.\nFlowed up the hill and down King William Street,\nTo where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours\nWith a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.\nThere I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying “Stetson!\n“You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!\n“That corpse you planted last year in your garden,\n“Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?\n“Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?\n“Oh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men,\n“Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again!\n“You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!”\n",

What Tiresias sees, in fact, is the substance of the poem. The whole passage from Ovid is of great anthropological interest:\n\n‘. . . Cum Iunone iocos et maior vestra profecto est\nQuam, quae contingit maribus,’ dixisse, ‘voluptas.’\nIlla negat; placuit quae sit sententia docti\nQuaerere Tiresiae: venus huic erat utraque nota.\nNam duo magnorum viridi coeuntia silva\nCorpora serpentum baculi violaverat ictu\nDeque viro factus, mirabile, femina septem\nEgerat autumnos; octavo rursus eosdem\nVidit et ‘est vestrae si tanta potentia plagae,’\nDixit ‘ut auctoris sortem in contraria mutet,\nNunc quoque vos feriam!’ percussis anguibus isdem\nForma prior rediit genetivaque venit imago.\nArbiter hic igitur sumptus de lite iocosa\nDicta Iovis firmat; gravius Saturnia iusto\nNec pro materia fertur doluisse suique\nIudicis aeterna damnavit lumina nocte,\nAt pater omnipotens (neque enim licet inrita cuiquam\nFacta dei fecisse deo) pro lumine adempto\nScire futura dedit poenamque levavit honore."
