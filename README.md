- links as first-class citizens
- the readme should answer the what, why, and the how of the project
some guide questions that will help you out:
  What was your motivation?
  Why did you build this project?
  What problem does it solve?
  What did you learn?
  What makes your project stand out?
  If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a "Features" section and listing them here.
- sections
  - title
  - description - The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project   from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:
    - What your application does,
    - Why you used the technologies you used,
    - Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.
  - how to install and run (steps)
  - how to use (with visual aids if necessary)
  - license
  - toc (if the readme is really long)

"Why don't we have parallel pages with visible connections?" (Ted Nelson)

Links as first-class citizens. In other words, its own separate type of data entity and API, or even filetype -- something external to pages or html files. The link is the mother of all meta-data. It is context itself. Its uses extend far beyond navigating between two pages or servers over hypertext protocol. There can be many types of links between two pages or documents. There are multiple scholarly fields that study and catalogue the different kinds of links between human readable documents. (See Discourse Analysis, Intertextuality in Literary Studies). Great advances have been made in A.I. for finding different kinds of links within texts (provide link to Tesserae and other sources), along with related things like Semantic Networks (not the Semantic Web, which is about machine readability). But the Web does not have real links (links as first-class citizens). The Web has embedded links -- links embedded in html. On the Web, links don't even get their own tag. They are just the href attribute on the anchor tag. Embedded links were necessary because the Web could not scale otherwise (provide source link). But advances in the last 15 years or so have brought lots of new possibilities to the foreground.
One of the most powerful uses of links, besides navigation, is in their visual rendering. The information that can be provided by graphically rendered links is deep and vast.
Citations in scientific articles are one example. Allusions in poetry and fiction. Quotations. Wikilinks and wikipages. Navigating your browsing history. These are all profoundly meaningful and useful human semantics.
One of the most powerful and popular mnemonics systems is Tony Buzan's Mind Maps. 
As the information glut grows exponentially worse, our brain's memory systems become overwhelmed. There are far too many things to juggle in the working memory and there's too many things to store in the long-term memory (courses, books, articles, etc). Visually rendering links naturally lends itself to mnemotechnics.
The Zettelkasten, meaning "slip box," has become increasingly popular idea. It was invented by Luhmann, a prolific sociologist and thinker. Notecards contain one atomistic concept, and they both contain conventional references and backlinks (back to the cards that reference them).
